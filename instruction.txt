QUESTION
Scenario: Online Bookstore

You are tasked with building an online bookstore using PHP. 
The bookstore 
should allow users to browse books, 
add them to their cart, and checkout. 
The website should also have an admin panel where the store owner can add and 
manage books, view orders, and update the website content.
Specific requirements for the project:

1. The homepage should display featured books, categories, and a search 
bar.

2. Users should be able to browse books by category and search for books 
by title, author, or keyword.

3. Each book should have a detailed page that displays its cover, title, 
author, price, description, and customer reviews.

4. Users should be able to add books to their cart, view their cart, and 
checkout.
5. The checkout process should allow users to enter their shipping and 
billing information and confirm their order.

6. The admin panel should allow the store owner to add and manage books, 
view orders, and update the website content (e.g. homepage featured 
books, category names and descriptions, etc.).

7. The admin panel should also allow the store owner to view and respond 
to customer reviews.

Use PHP to handle the backend logic and MySQL to store the data (e.g. books, 
categories, orders, etc.). You can also use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build 
the frontend of the website and make it responsive and user-friendly. [20 marks
